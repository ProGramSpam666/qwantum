N_G = cuttoff for number of plane waves (Sum from 1 to N_G)
N_b = number of bands considering (think y direction)
N_k = number of k points (think discretization x direction)
N = energy levels

ek = eigenenergies 
ck = eigenfunctions (wavefunctions)

plotBand = plotting the shape of ck
plotFun = plotting wavefunctions, will need both ek and ck

OPTIMAL BASIS
invovlves taking ck vector (matrix) and optimising by performing gram schmidt orthonormalisation algoritm
