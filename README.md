This relevant Qwantum file is the focus of the investigation, being to numerically obtain solutions to the 1P schrodinger equation with periodic potential for a standard basis and for the implementation of an optimal basis, which is introduced to demonstrate significant reduction in the computation cost of obtaining such solutions.


(1): Solving with standard basis

The approach for numerically solving the 1P schrodinger equation using a standard basis is as follows:

Firstly, the periodic potential is to be introduced.  This can be seen from the relevant potential.py file.  In this file, two classes are introduced: The first class is the Potential class, defined to formualte the parameters of the potential itself.
